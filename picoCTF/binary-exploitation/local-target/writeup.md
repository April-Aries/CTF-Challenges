# Problem Description

Smash the stack
Can you overflow the buffer and modify the other local variable?
The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/519/local-target). You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/519/local-target.c).

> Hint 1: Do anything you can to change `num`.
> Hint 2: When you change num, view the value as hexadecimal.

# Solution

The problem gives flag to me unless I am able to cover the local variable `num` from 64 to 65 via entering a string. In *local-target.c*, I take advantage on `gets(input);` when the program asks me to input a string. `gets` doesn't check the size of input and keeps covering data until meeting `\0`.

To build the payload, I need to determine how many bytes to put before 65. My first guess is 16 bytes since the size of `input` is 16. However, I figure out it is 24 after some trial and error. The possible reason might be the align issue of the environment.

Sending payload with 24 characters then input 65, which is `A`, will solve this problem. Namely, example payload is `123456789012345678901234A`.
